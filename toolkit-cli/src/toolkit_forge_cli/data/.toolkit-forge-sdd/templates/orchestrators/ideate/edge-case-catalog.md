# Edge Case Catalog

## Metadata
| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Cycle ID | `{{cycleId}}` |
| Prepared By |  |
| Review Date |  |

## Traceability Matrix
| Edge Case ID | Requirement ID | Description | Forge Module | Environment | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Forge Platform Fit
- Highlight platform limits or behaviours that influence edge case handling (timeouts, storage, auth, rate limits).

## Content Core
### Edge Case Entries
| ID | Scenario | Expected Behaviour | Detection Strategy | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Recovery & Communication Plan
- Define messaging to users when edge cases occur.
- Outline rollback or retry mechanisms.

## Quality Gates
| Gate | Status | Evidence | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Edge cases tested? |  |  |  |
| Monitoring requirements documented? |  |  |  |
| Support documentation updated? |  |  |  |

## Next Steps
- Feed high-severity edge cases into Architect and Plan stages for mitigation.
- Schedule validation or simulation sessions.
