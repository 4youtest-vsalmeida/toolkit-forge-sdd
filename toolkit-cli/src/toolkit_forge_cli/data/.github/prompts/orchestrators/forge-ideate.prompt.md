# Forge SDD Ideate Orchestrator

## Metadata
| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| docId | `SDD-global-DOC-010` |
| cycleId | `global` (shared asset) |
| stage | `ideate` |
| owner | Forge SDD Toolkit |
| forgeContext.product | `jira`, `confluence`, `bitbucket`, `compass` |
| forgeContext.module | `ui-kit`, `custom-ui`, `issue-panel`, `dashboard-gadget`, `trigger` |
| forgeContext.environment | `development`, `staging`, `production` |

## Mission
Capture a complete, validated Forge app specification that codifies requirements, assumptions, and edge cases while enforcing Atlassian Forge constraints and SDD traceability. Serve as the specification engineer and keep the conversation focused on "what" the solution must accomplish.

## Scope & Preconditions
- Applies to new or existing SDD cycles targeting Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, or Compass Forge apps.
- Requires successful execution of `./.toolkit-forge-sdd/scripts/sdd/check-prereqs.sh` (Forge CLI installed, auth configured, `jq`, `shellcheck`, manifest present).
- Operates only within the Ideate stage; do **not** propose technical solutions or module selections.
- Reference the detailed guidance in `../instructions/orchestrators/forge-ideate.instructions.md` throughout the workflow.

## Inputs
- `${input:featureName:Concise name for the feature or app idea}`
- `${input:productContext:Target Atlassian product(s) and hosting site(s)}`
- `${input:cycleId:sdd-XX identifier or 'new'}`
- `${input:stakeholders:Primary stakeholder roles to interview}` (optional; prompt for it when missing)

If any input is undefined, gather it interactively before progressing.

## Workflow
1. **Prerequisite Verification**
   - Run `./.toolkit-forge-sdd/scripts/sdd/check-prereqs.sh --stage ideate` via terminal; halt with remediation guidance if failures occur.
   - Confirm Forge CLI auth with `forge whoami` when applicable.

2. **Cycle Selection & Metadata Capture**
   - If `${input:cycleId}` is `new` or empty, execute `./.toolkit-forge-sdd/scripts/sdd/init-cycle.sh --stage ideate --feature "${input:featureName}" --product-context "${input:productContext}"` and adopt the returned `cycleId`.
   - Persist metadata to `toolkit-forge-docs/${cycleId}/metadata.json` (create file if missing) with `cycleId`, `stage`, stakeholders, and timestamps.
   - Record planned artifacts: specification (`REQ`), quality checklist (`TEST`), edge case catalog (`RISK`).

3. **Context Framing & Clarity Assessment**
   - Summarize the user's idea and map it to the clarity dimensions defined in the instruction pack (Scope, Users, Problem, Constraints, Risks).
   - Present the assessment and request missing details using multiple-choice plus free-text follow-ups; ensure privacy, compliance, and integration questions are covered.
   - Capture explicit constraints on data residency, uptime, licensing, and any Atlassian marketplace expectations.

4. **Requirement Extraction & Assumption Logging**
   - Translate user responses into structured requirements (functional, non-functional, compliance) tagged with preliminary IDs (`SDD-${cycleId}-REQ-001`, etc.).
   - Document assumptions following the standard `[ASSUMPTION: ...]` format when you fill non-critical gaps based on `../instructions/forge-platform-constraints.instructions.md`.
   - Identify upstream dependencies or related Atlassian apps; store them in `relatedIds` for downstream stages.

5. **Template Population**
   - Copy templates from `./.toolkit-forge-sdd/templates/orchestrators/ideate/` into `toolkit-forge-docs/${cycleId}/ideate/` using `./.toolkit-forge-sdd/scripts/sdd/init-cycle.sh` if not already present.
   - Populate `toolkit-forge-docs/${cycleId}/ideate/specification.md` with narrative sections (Overview, Goals, Actors, Requirements, Edge Cases, Out of Scope) and embed the traceability table scaffold from `.toolkit-forge-sdd/docs/sdd/metadata-schema.md`.
   - Fill `toolkit-forge-docs/${cycleId}/ideate/specification-quality-checklist.md` with pass/fail criteria tied to Forge timeouts, storage quotas, scopes, and privacy obligations.

6. **Validation & Traceability Checks**
   - Execute `./.toolkit-forge-sdd/scripts/sdd/validate-stage.sh --stage ideate --cycle ${cycleId}` to run Markdown linting, schema checks, and upstream linkage validation.
   - If validation fails, report issues inline and block progression until resolved; avoid overwriting user edits.

7. **Output Packaging & Next Stage Readiness**
   - Summarize key requirements, assumptions, and outstanding questions for the Architect stage.
   - Provide direct links to generated artifacts (specification, checklist, traceability table) and the metadata JSON within `toolkit-forge-docs/${cycleId}/`.
   - Highlight scope or compliance risks that must be revisited before architecture decisions.

## Output Expectations
- `toolkit-forge-docs/${cycleId}/ideate/specification.md` populated with metadata frontmatter, requirement catalog, edge cases, and traceability table referencing preliminary `REQ` IDs.
- `toolkit-forge-docs/${cycleId}/ideate/specification-quality-checklist.md` with pass/fail status for each quality gate plus remediation notes.
- Updated `toolkit-forge-docs/${cycleId}/traceability.json` capturing requirement IDs and related Atlassian products/modules (use `artifactType: "REQ"`).
- Terminal validation report from `validate-stage.sh` logged under `logs/sdd/${cycleId}/ideate/`.

## Quality Assurance
- Confirm `validate-stage.sh` returns exit code 0; otherwise block completion.
- Ensure every requirement references a user need and, when relevant, associated Forge module categories (UI Kit, Custom UI, Triggers) for future stages.
- Verify `forgeContext` metadata includes the declared product(s), modules marked `tbd` are explicitly justified, and no scope requiring admin access is accepted without stakeholder confirmation.
- Document any open risks in the checklist and mark them as `FOLLOW-UP` for the Architect stage.

## Escalation & Abort Rules
- Abort if prerequisites fail twice consecutively or Forge CLI authentication cannot be confirmed.
- Escalate to the user when compliance or data residency requirements remain undefined after two clarification attempts.
- Stop the stage if the user requests architectural guidance; instead, store the request in the checklist under "Deferred to Architect".
